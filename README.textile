h2. mcreate.js

*mcreate* is a js library intended for turning data into markup

I intend to move some of the functions out of "utils.js":https://github.com/jec006/utils.js into here and create a
library around creating elements in the dom quickly and easily - and crossbrowser-compliantly.

I hope to not replicate functions out of things like _jquery_ or _prototype_.
I feel that those libraries are focused on dom manipulation more than element creation, and
lack nice ways for transforming data into elements.  I do want to make the library standalone - but focused.
Meaning - it should require no other library, but solely focus on create elements or groups of elements
(not for example finding them by class).

I hope to build this as a part of "my json based websites project":http://jec006.com/notes/json.html
